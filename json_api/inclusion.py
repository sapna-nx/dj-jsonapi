# Inclusion is similar to pagination in that it modifies both the queryset as well
# as the response data. pagination provides `paginate_queryset` as well as
# `get_paginated_response` methods.

# Inclusion is similar. It should have a method for potentially modifying the queryset
# and a method for altering the response data.

# note that the queryset modification ties pagination/inclusion to the generic view
# implementations, as they are both reliant on Django's ORM.
# - The generic view provides a `paginator` hook for resolving the `pagination_class`
#   into the actual paginator instance.
# - The generic view provides a `paginate_queryset` and `get_paginated_response`
#   methods which proxy the actual implementation of the paginator.

# get_paginated_response is an incorrect optimization, as the paginator knows too
# little about json-api to construct a well formed, paginated response.

# The problem with the inclusion implementation is that we cannot mimic
# paginate_queryset. This method returns a list of objects instead of a queryset, so
# queryset modification ends here.

    An inclusion implementation that uses related resource views to determine path
    validity and render the associated resource objects.

    Related resource inclusion is controlled through the `include_rels` attribute. It
    accepts a list of `relname`s or the special keyword '__all__'. Includable rels can
    be disabled by setting the value to None.

    You can set the default included relationships with the `includes` attribute on the
    view class. This accepts a list of relationship paths.

        class PersonViewSet(viewsets.ResourceViewSet):
            ...
